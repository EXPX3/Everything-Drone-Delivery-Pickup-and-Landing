# Everything-Drone-Delivery-Pickup-and-Landing.
# NOTE: Work in Progress (WIP), Feel free to make any suggestions, remarks via github issues / pull requests. 
Purpose of this repo is to keep track of academic research and realworld adoption of Drone delivery, pickup and landing technology. Expect, implementations and references to open-source contributions, publications, interviews etc any media relavant to the topic.  

# No universal Drone delivery , pickup and landing algorithm. Shall be tailored specifically for usecase. 
## Popular usecases already thriving in real-world  ...
1. Last Mile Drone Delivery Ex: [wing](https://wing.com/), [Flytrex](https://www.flytrex.com/), ... (list will be updated to include all note worthy drone delivery companies and capabilities like payload, flight time, distance coverage etc.. )    
2. Hub to Hub Delivery
3. Disaster response / Search and Rescue
4. Remote location delivery drones Ex: High altitudes, sparsely populated areas, Long distances travel etc.
5. ...

6. ...

# Algorithms & Benchmarking strategies
## Types of Drone Delivery and landing zone detection algorithms ...
1. Mathematical models and preset heuristic rules - point cloud data as input - for gemoetric terrain charecteristics (Hazard metrics) analyisis ex: slope, roughness, obstacle offset, point density and size of the Delivery / landing areas.
   - Drawbacks: lack of semantic information of terrain objects like water, complex unstable flat surface etc
   - Positive: simple and computationally cheap
2. Image processing-based methods - images as input - for visual edge, pattern, texture analyisis ex: uniform region in an image may point to flat region, edges may highlight boundaries etc.
   - Drawbacks: performance directly depend on lighting and altitude, manual parameter tuning, do not guarentee optimal perfomance
   - Positive:  cheap hardware
3. AI based methods:
   - image based DL:
   - Lidar based DL:
   - image+Lidar based DL:
4. New sensible potential combinations of above methods.
5. ...

## Benchmarking 
1. Opensourced Data sets with ground truth information: algorithms can be tetsed on this publicly available datasets and publish performance results. Example datasets: [ECLAIR: A High-Fidelity Aerial LiDAR Dataset for Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/SharperShape/eclair-dataset), [MUN-FRL: Aerial Visual-Inertial-LiDAR Odometry and Mapping Dataset](https://mun-frl-vil-dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [MARS-LVIG Dataset: A multi-sensor aerial robots SLAM dataset for LiDAR-visual-inertial-GNSS fusion](https://mars.hku.hk/dataset.html), ...
2. Monte-Carlo simulations based benchmarking (implementation available):  for each hazard metric independently, adjusting its value across the acceptable-to-unacceptable range while maintaining other metrics within thresholds. Thresholds for hazard metrics, such as relief, roughness, slope, radius, and point density, are determined based on the UASâ€™s landing gear ground clearance, maximum offset from surroundings, and intended operating height. Doing so the edge case behaviour of the Delivery / Landing zone detection method is studied with an aim of evaluating the algorithm for its success rate, computation time and memory in the current implementaion.
